<p style="font-family:Arial;" align="center"> this first quarter of grade 9 ict, i learned many new things about html that weren't discussed in grade 8. these new functions, albeit complicated, give me more ideas and abilities when i make webpages. the lessons tackled help me make my webpage have more creative features, and i hope to learn more about coding in the following quarter. i especially want to learn more about designing and the layout of webpages, which i am aware will be tackled in css. </p>
